Update the following:
#### discussions on the problem:
This is what I took away from reading the prompt: 

- A user will define the region, you must fill it with random (size and location) rectangles.

Now luckily, I wrote down my thoughts on what conditions should consider when making the rectangles. It's a pretty sparse list since it was based on the steps I made for myself as I worked through it.

##### Conditions:
 - Q. What if the Tower is larger than the region or partially in/out of region?
     A. Limit the max coordinates of x0,y0,x1,y1 generated by randint. Namely x0 can go from 0->X-1 and y0 from 0->Y-1. Why -1 and not just X and Y? x1 and y1 need to appear somewhere in the region so I don't have to deal with a x0 = max range(X) and y0=max range(Y)
 - Q. What if a tower is enclosed entirely in a previously established region?
     A. This was a hard one. Mostly that it was hard to detect as it didn't violate an edge of a previously established rectangle but my function could still detect that an overlap was occurring. I first noticed it when the program would try to reference something that wasn't established because it wasn't trimmed and therefore assigned to a Tower instance. Once I could consistently find that encompassed rectangle, I couldn't delete it, but I also didn't want it's area adding to the total covered area. So I essentially collapsed it to a single point with no depth. That means it's area would be zero.
 - Q. How will I store the information of each tower?
     A. Structs!... wait...does Python have structs?... Google says no. Alright I'll just use dictionaries that store the tower and it's information. But that seems like a lot of work. So I asked a friend in the class what he did. He made a Tower class. Genius. So yeah I ended up with a Tower class that has a settable index so it can be indexed in a dict I did ultimately create. However that dict stores the index (an integer) as a string so it'll be an immutable key, and the Tower itself was the stored "value".
     
     
#### trade-offs:
ImageDraw vs Numpy
#### limitations details:
Limitations of ImageDraw
- Region
- Pixel
#### analysis:
Now a big question is: How can I make the output user friendly? If I was given a rectangle maker, what would I want to know?
- How many Rectangles are on this plot?
- How much of the plot is currently covered?
- How many wildly different rectangles would be needed to fill a region I define (on average preferably)?
To me, being able to convey answers to these questions either through output or pictures would make this a complete project. However, I must be mindful of what I can complete in the time given to me such that I don't try to add so much that I don't finish in time. 
#### good visualizations:
 - Are my plots good? No outlines for the rectangles unfortunately, ImageDraw makes it look weird.
#### examples of your results:
- average number of towers to fill region of 10X10, 50x50, 100x100
